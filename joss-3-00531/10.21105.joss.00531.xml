    <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
    <p>Solving systems of non-linear equations numerically is a common task in scientific modeling work. Many software libraries have the capability to solve these kinds of systems, however, each require slightly different forms of input. In addition, it is often important that the user formulates the system in a manner which is suitable for the numerical algorithm. Finding an effective formulation is often an iterative process, which is facilitated if the system can be transformed symbolically.</p>
    <p><em>pyneqsys</em> offers a common interface to a handful of solvers. It furthermore provides tools to input and work with such systems symbolically. Having a symbolic representation allows <em>pyneqsys</em> to automatically derive the Jacobian matrix, which is a task which is laborious and a source of error when performed by hand. By relying on a computer algebra system, <em>pyneqsys</em> allows the user to apply e.g. variable transformations or generate representations in LaTeX, MathML etc. By default SymPy <span class="citation" data-cites="Meurer2017">(Meurer et al. 2017)</span> is used as the symbolic back-end, but other libraries are also supported.</p>
    <p>Adapting <em>pyneqsys</em> to use new third party solvers is straightforward and some example solvers are provided with the library. Together with its ability to perform variable transformations symbolically <em>pyneqsys</em> allows the users to write code for their problem <em>once</em> and then easily test different formulations and solvers. This greatly lowers the burden of validation and speeds-up the iterative finding of the best method for solving the problem.</p>
