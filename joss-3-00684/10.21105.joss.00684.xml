    <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
    <p>Forensic DNA profiles from the Y-chromosome are valuable when there is a mixture of male-source and female-source DNA, and interest centres on the identity of the male source(s) of the DNA (as only males have Y-chromosomes). This happens for example when a male has been accused of assaulting a female.</p>
    <p>The problem of evaluating evidential weight is even more challenging for Y-profiles than for autosomal profiles that are based on the non-sex chromosomes. At the core of the weight of evidence for autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) profiles used in forensic genetics is the <em>match probability</em>, which is the conditional probability that a particular individual <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> has a matching profile, given that the queried contributor, <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span>, has it <span class="citation" data-cites="DJBwoe2">(Steele and Balding 2015)</span>. Matching at a single, autosomal STR allele is relatively common: typically a few percent of individuals from the same population share a given allele. The probability of matching is increased when <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is a relative of <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span>, but for typical population sizes most of the individuals sharing a given allele are not closely related to <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span>.</p>
    <p>However, unlike for autosomal profiles, Y-profile matches are due to patrilineal relatedness that is typically too remote to be recognized, but close compared with the relatedness of random pairs from the population <span class="citation" data-cites="AndersenPLOSGEN2017">(Andersen and Balding 2017)</span>. This was described by <span class="citation" data-cites="AndersenPLOSGEN2017">(Andersen and Balding 2017)</span> that also propose a way to interpret a matching Y-chromosomal profile given these properties. The proposed interpretation was based on the distribution of the number of males with Y-profile matching that of the queried contributor <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span>. Analyses in <span class="citation" data-cites="AndersenPLOSGEN2017">(Andersen and Balding 2017)</span> were performed by a simulation model to approximate the distribution of the number of men in a population with matching Y-profiles. Key parameters of the model include the STR locus mutation rates, the variance in reproductive success <span class="citation" data-cites="AndersenPLOSGEN2017">(Andersen and Balding 2017)</span> (VRS), and the population growth rate. The simulation model was implemented and made available in the easy-to-use open-source software presented in this paper: <code>malan</code> (<strong>MA</strong>le <strong>L</strong>ineage <strong>AN</strong>alysis).</p>
    <p>The <code>malan</code> software is made available as an R <span class="citation" data-cites="R">(R Core Team 2018)</span> package with extensive use of C++ for efficient computations via Rcpp <span class="citation" data-cites="Rcpp">(Eddelbuettel and Balamuta 2017)</span>. This software was used for the analyses performed in <span class="citation" data-cites="AndersenPLOSGEN2017">(Andersen and Balding 2017)</span>. The simulation model allows for flexible simulations by first simulating a genealogy (with population sizes at each generation specified by a vector) with different parameters as described by <span class="citation" data-cites="AndersenPLOSGEN2017">(Andersen and Balding 2017)</span>. A forensic Y-chromosome profile typically consists of the allele at between 15 and 30 STR loci <span class="citation" data-cites="Butler05">(Butler et al. 2005)</span> and is often referred to as a Y-STR haplotype. In the simulated genealogy, the <code>malan</code> software makes it possible to impose Y-STR haplotypes in different ways.</p>
    <p>The <code>malan</code> software makes it possible to query the population in multiple ways. For example to count the number of males in the population with a certain Y-STR haplotype. Or obtain the distribution of number of meioses between a queried contributor and the individuals in the population with a matching Y-STR haplotype.</p>
    <p>The documentation of <code>malan</code> consists of manual pages for the various available functions, articles describing how to perform contiguous analyses (<em>vignettes</em>), and unit tests.</p>
    <p>I would like to thank David J Balding for helpful discussions.</p>
